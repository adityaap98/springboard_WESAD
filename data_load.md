# Background

Here is detailed definition of tasks, techniques and script files which used to load and parse initial data.

#Intro
In this observation 17 subjects where participated but as stated in 
annotation ([wesad_readme.pdf](assets/wesad_readme.pdf)), due to sensor 
malfunction, data of two subjects had to be discarded 

The dataset is organised so that each subject has a folder(SX, where X = subject ID).


There are three groups of sources to be considered and thus should be grouped.

1. Information about subject itself.
Those are stored inside every subject's folder in files: SX_readme.txt and SX_quest.csv


2. Information from **RespiBAN** device stored in filr SX_respiban.txt

3. Information from **Empatica E4** device stored in folder SX_EX_Data.
(Inside every folder there is SX_SE_Data.zip file which extracted in place)


File SX.pkl contains synchronised data between two devices and is not reflected in current document.

Format of every file is in details explained in wesad_readme.pdf file, however it is worth to mention in brief.

#File Formats
###Subject Information

SX_readme.txt: contains information about the subject (SX) and information about data collection.
This is free form text with easy detected pattern as shown in this example:

```
### Personal information ###
Age: 25
Height (cm): 175
Weight (kg): 90
Gender: male
Dominant hand: right

### Study pre-requisites ###
Did you drink coffee today? NO
Did you drink coffee within the last hour? NO
Did you do any sports today? NO
Are you a smoker? NO
Did you smoke within the last hour? NO
Do you feel ill today? NO

### Additional notes ###
-
```

SX_quest.csv: contains all relevant information to obtain ground truth, including the protocol 
schedule for SX and answers to the self-report questionnaires. how is in picture above:

![QUEST_FORMAT](assets/quest_csv.png)


Relatively easy to parse. For detailed explanation see [wesad_readme.pdf](assets/wesad_readme.pdf)

### RespiBAN Device Format

File contains header lines starting with '#' symbol and the rest is 'tab' separated numbers which are
explained in details. Relatively easy to parse and clean. 
See details [here](http://www.biosignalsplux.com/en/respiban-professional).

Because of big size this file is not included in repository.

---
### Empatica E4 Device Format

Here is short instruction set from "readme" file:
```
Raw data is contained in SX_E4_Data.zip. When unzipped, the following files contain derived 
information and thus should be ignored in this dataset: HR.csv, IBI.csv, tags.csv.
The file info.txt contains some details on the folderâ€™s content.
```

File _info.txt_ contains detailed format explanation for every .csv file.


Having this instruction those python scripts got created to parse and load data into sets for further analyses.


#Parser Files

####Parser for SX_readme.txt
As file SX_readme.txt is not a data frame but just overall information 
about subject, so regular python tools may be used to parse and collect data.
See file [readme_parser.py](parsers/readme_parser.py)

Appropriate comments made in the source code.


####Parser for SX_quest.csv

File quest.csv in reality not a data frame but unstructured source for various questions with answers.

Every type of question set should be parsed on its way.

File [quest_parser.py](parsers/quest_parser.py) is initial set of parsing and reading.
